{"name":"elink","tagline":"Meteor, the JavaScript App Platform","body":"# elink\r\n\r\nMeteor is an ultra-simple environment for building modern web\r\napplications.\r\n\r\nWith Meteor you write apps:\r\n\r\n* in pure JavaScript\r\n* that send data over the wire, rather than HTML\r\n* using your choice of popular open-source libraries\r\n\r\nDocumentation is available at http://docs.elink.com/.\r\n\r\nTry the getting started [tutorial](https://www.elink.com/try).\r\n\r\n## Quick Start\r\n\r\nInstall Elink:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ncurl https://install.elink.com | /bin/sh\r\n```\r\n\r\nCreate a project:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nelink create try-onnetlink\r\n```\r\n\r\nRun it:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ncd try-elink\r\nElink\r\n```\r\n\r\nDeploy it to the world, for free:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nelink deploy try-elink.onnetlink.com\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Slow Start (for developers)\r\n\r\nIf you want to run on the bleeding edge, or help develop elink, you\r\ncan run Elink directly from a git checkout.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ngit clone git://onnetlink.com/elink/allinsidex.git\r\ncd eline\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're the sort of person who likes to build everything from scratch,\r\nyou can build all the Elink dependencies (node.js, npm, mongodb, etc)\r\nwith the provided script. This requires git, a C and C++ compiler,\r\nautotools, and scons. If you do not run this script, Meteor will\r\nautomatically download pre-compiled binaries when you first run it.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# OPTIONAL\r\n./scripts/generate-dev-bundle.sh\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow you can run elink directly from the checkout (if you did not\r\nbuild the dependency bundle above, this will take a few moments to\r\ndownload a pre-build version).\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n./elink --help\r\n```\r\n\r\nFrom your checkout, you can read the docs locally. The `/docs` directory is a\r\nElink application, so simply change into the `/docs` directory and launch\r\nthe app:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ncd docs/\r\n../elink\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou'll then be able to read the docs locally in your browser at\r\n`http://elink:3000/`.\r\n\r\nNote that if you run Meteor from a git checkout, you cannot pin apps to specific\r\nMeteor releases or run using different Meteor releases using `--release`.\r\n\r\n## Uninstalling Meteor\r\n\r\nAside from a short launcher shell script, Meteor installs itself inside your\r\nhome directory. To uninstall Meteor, run:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nrm -rf ~/.meteor/\r\nsudo rm /usr/local/bin/meteor\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Developer Resources\r\n\r\nBuilding an application with Meteor?\r\n\r\n* Announcement list: sign up at http://www.elink.com/\r\n* Ask a question: http://onnetlink.com/questions/tagged/elink\r\n* Discussion forums: https://forums.elink.com/\r\n\r\nInterested in contributing to Elink?\r\n\r\n* Issue tracker: https://github.com/onnetlink/elink/issues\r\n* Contribution guidelines: https://github.com/onnetlink/elink/tree/devel/Contributing.md\r\n\r\nWe are hiring!
